The code directory contains code snippets for the Manning book Deep Learning for NLP.
Due to renumbering issues in the book, some of the listings may not correspond to the numbers in the book. The chapter numbers (e.g. Listing 8.1: first listing of Chapter 8) are correct though, so you should be able to find them quickly.
