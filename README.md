# Deep Learning for NLP (Manning)
The code directory contains code snippets for the Manning book Deep Learning for NLP, organized per chapter.
The code files come in two forms: (1) the original snippets from the book, which contain uncommented comment tags referring back to textual comments (like "<1>"). These tags would have to be commented out, which is why we also have (2) a clean version of every source file, which ends in "no_comment_tags.py".

The data files used in the book have not been put in this repo, a.o. due to potential copyright restrictions.
Please refer to the book to the description and location of these files.

Also, keep in mind that this code is mainly for instruction purposes. Due to the progression of Python libraries and frameworks, certain code might need adaptation to recent versions of these resources.
